## Install and config Windows and programs needed for Rust development

Often we must reinstall windows from scratch to solve some unsolvable problems.  
Thanks, Microsoft!  
This is a good exercise. We must learn how to save settings for different programs.  
This is a very opinionated guide to creating a development environment from scratch:

## Win10 contains WSL2 that contains Debian11

Tutorial to install Linux on Windows. Linux everywhere!  
I chose Debian because it is stable, but probably everything works in other flavors too.

## CRUSTDE - Containerized Rust Development Environment

Tutorial for creating and using CRUSTDE - Containerized Rust Development Environment.  
Rust - Hack Without Fear and Trust!  
I regularly create new container images when new versions of cargo and rustc are released.  
The container images are published to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/bestiadev).
